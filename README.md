## Usage

#### libpython-clj projects can now be created quickly in 2 ways from the latest stable template:


-   **without** clj-new installed in user deps.edn

```bash 

# example
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {seancorfield/clj-new {:mvn/version "0.8.6"}}}' \
  -m clj-new.create \
  https://github.com/clj-python/clj-template@5b36a33ec79c0c0152317146deca0f37b336365d \
  appcompany.funapp
```

-    **with** clj-new [installed](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new) in user deps.edn (recommended)

```bash 
# example
clj -A:new \
  https://github.com/clj-python/clj-template@5b36a33ec79c0c0152317146deca0f37b336365d \
  appcompany.funapp
```
